# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Chinyere Azukwu and Andy Nguyen

The program is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game, where the user chooses being either X or O and goes against a computer.

	•	The Screen initially starts with a layout of nine blank buttons and a choice of two buttons above it for the user to chooses whether they want to be X or O . 
	•	Once the user picks either X or O, the person that goes first is determined randomly. Once the player  or computer gets 3 Xs or Os in a row or diagonally a window will pop up determining if the person won, loss or drew.
	•	The user can play the game as many times as they want because they can clear the board after finishing a game by pressing restart. The game also keeps track of the score by increasing Player by 1 if the player wins. It increases Computer by 1 if the player loses and it increases Draw by 1 every time the game ends in a tie.
